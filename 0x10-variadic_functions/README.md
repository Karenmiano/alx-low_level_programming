Sometimes we need that a function can be able to process any number of arguments without creating other functions with similar code only differring with the number of arguments they are accepting, that is where the concept of variadic functions becomes useful. To declare and use variadic functions the C language has provided function like macros contained in stdarg.h. They are va_start, va_arg and va_end. These macros will be used to access the list of arguments and process them accordingly. This directory will contain programs mostly related to this topic.
