The C programming language allows us to pass data to our programs at run time. This is achieved using the function main which can accept arguments using the prototype int main(int argc, char \*argv[]). When compiling we will the have the program name first followed by the relevant parameter eg ./myprogram 1 2 3. Argc is the number of arguments passed and argv is an array of pointers to char since the arguments are passed as strings.In this directory I'll be doing practice projects based on this topic.
