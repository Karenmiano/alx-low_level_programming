In this directory we are going to explore the concept of functions in C. So what are functions? Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are a fundamental building block of modular programming and help in organizing and structuring code into logical units. They make our programs more readable and are also reusable. Together with that we are also going to explore the concept of header files which are files in which we write function declarations, macro definitions...and are used by the compiler to confirm the functionssignature as used in a program.
