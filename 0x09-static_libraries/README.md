A library is a collection of pre-compiled object files with related code. These object files are functions, classes, variables etc that are commonly used and instead of always having to write our code from scratch we could just use them. The code in these libraries can be made available to our programs by two ways, either statically or dynamically. Static linking involves copying the functions called into the executable but in dynamic linking the code for functions in the library is made available at run time and control will be transferred to the function when needed and then back to our program once it is done.
