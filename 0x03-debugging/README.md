In the process of writing software sometimes the way we want our code to run is not exactly how we end up writing it since as humans we don't have such a global view of things, then we have to go back to our code and sift it  and after fix the parts that are leading to the mishaps. This is what we call debugging. It is more of trying to understand how the computer is processing the code you've written from the top in order to catch the moment when the error(bug) is happening.
