Depending on the problem at hand a programmer must figure out a way to efficiently organize the data for their program to ease storage, search, use and even addition of more data. The different methods used are known as data structures. Linked lists is a linear data structure in which unlike arrays elements(called nodes) are not stored contiguously in memory but rather each node is linked to the next using a pointer.This directory will have practice projects on singly linked lists. Singly linked lists are basically made up of structures where one of the members of the struct is a pointer which will be used to store the address of the next node therefore eventually linking all these spread out nodes in memory.
