In C we can declare pointers to functions which will hold the start address of the code related to the function. A simple syntax for declaration would be void (\*ptr)(int), this one is simply a pointer to a function that accepts an int as an argument and returns nothing. Functionpointers can equally be passed as arguments to functions just like other pointers aside from many other functionalities that we can achieve with them.
